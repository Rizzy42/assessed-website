# Y8 Assessed website
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To build this site, you'll need to have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed. Clone the GitHub repository and run `yarn install`. Then run `yarn dev` to fire up the development server and view the site.

## What tools have I used to build this?
* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), a powerful, high-performance frontend library
* [svelte-routing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-routing): a client-side routing library that supports server-side rendering (SSR)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org): JavaScript with more control
* [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax): CSS with a few extras to make my life easier
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home): a simple but powerful hosting platform
